          <h4>Noise Cancelling</h4>
          <p>
            A headphone that features active noise cancellation includes a
            microphone on the earpiece to detect the incoming sound signals of
            the external (unwanted) noise. A battery-driven circuit generates
            the inverted wave on the fly, and adds it in to the music signal
            that is delivered to your ear. The generated sound signal acts to
            cancel out the background noise from the external sources.
          </p>
          <p>
            Generally speaking, noise canceling is what most people are actually
            looking for when they think of either of these terms. Those famous
            Bose and Sony headphones you see reviewed and advertised? Those are
            noise canceling. The fundamental difference is that noise canceling
            is an active, electronic process. Noise isolating is, basically,
            passive — something to wedge in your ears to block out sound.
            They’re basically earplugs, except they can pipe in your Spotify.
          </p>
          <p>
            Microphones built into noise-canceling headphones listen to and
            analyze the sound waves of the world around you. Then, an inverse of
            that wave is created by the headphone. Sending a trough when there’s
            a peak, and sending a peak when there’s a trough. Sending a
            compression when there’s a rarefaction, and sending a rarefaction
            when there’s a compression. When the “real” sound of the outside
            world and this manufactured “opposite” sound hit your ear, they
            cancel each other out.
          </p>
          <p>
            Done well, the results are impressive. The best noise canceling
            headphones can reduce certain noises significantly. They work best
            on low-frequency, droning sounds. Aircraft engines are a great
            example. Car tire and engine noise on the highway is another. Even
            noisy air conditioners can be reduced fairly well.

          <h4>Noise Isolating</h4>
          <p>
            Most in-ear headphones (aka earbuds) that go into your ear canal
            are, to some extent, noise isolating. How much ambient sound
            noise-isolating headphones reduce is a combination of their design
            and how well they fit in your ears. Everyone’s ears are different,
            and getting the right fit is crucial with any headphone. Doubly so
            if you’re trying to keep out the noise around you. Not only will a
            bad fit let in more ambient noise, but it will “let out” bass.
            Changing the tips on your earbuds could radically change the sound,
            and perhaps greatly improve their noise isolation abilities. Most
            headphones come with multiple tips. It’s worth trying them all to
            see what you like best. There are also aftermarket tips available
            for many earbuds, some even with memory foam that might work better
            for you.
